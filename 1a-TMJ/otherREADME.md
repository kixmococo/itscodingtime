# The Meaningful Journey 
ie, TMJ is a sidescroller platformer. it is in C++ and is using SDL2.
# Designed on 
Linux with for Linux, Windows and Android (i am iffy on the android part but ambitiously motivated) i used these
# Resources
Linux/ubuntu, gimp, git/github, sdl2, windows/mingw64, android/ndk and various free and not free assets; im not crediting allat shit. i should mention
# Disclaimer
I would like to port it on macOS as well but i currently do not have the resources for that and do not plan on it either that will be a "later down the line thing". also, this is mainly a learning project so expect irregularities and LOTS of footnotes. Let's go over the

# to be honest, after writing this all out i realized it would make a lot more sense to put a notes file in each of the directories instead of doing all this... still update as needed
